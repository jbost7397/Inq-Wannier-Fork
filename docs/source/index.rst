**INQ** is an engine for electronic structure calculations.
It can work in three ways, as a standalone electronic structure code, as a library to implement complex electronic structure methods, or as a proxy-app to evaluate the performance of electronic structure algorithms in high-performance computing platforms.
It concentrates on algorithms as a portability hardware layer, generic types, and flexibility of usage.
